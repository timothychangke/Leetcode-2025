3. Pseudo Code:

    2. Initialise a count array and a res array. The count array will save the number of nodes under that particular node
    3. Perform a dfs with the parameters of cur node, parent node and depth
        - Set the current count to be 1
        - If cur not equal to parent (have to make sure the node doesnt go back up)
            - For each neighbour of the current node, increment the count by performing dfs on that node, also add to the distance of the root node

Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

1. Edge Case: 
2. Idea: A Preorder traversal starts from the root and goes down, while the inorder traversal starts from the left most node. The first node in the preorder traversal will be the root while the middle node will be the root in the inorder traversal
Identifying the index of the root not in the inorder traversal will help split the tree into the left and right subtrees, of which the preorder traversal will have the same number of nodes. We can then use this to generate the left and right subtrees
3. Pseudo Code
    1. Initialise a dfs function that takes in the preorder and inorder Arrays
    2. Terminal condition: if the either of the arrays are empty, return a null value
    3. Else, find the index of the first element in the preorder array in the inorder array. This is the middle index
    4. return the node of this middle index where its left tree the function dfs() of the left half of the index before the middle and the left half of the index after the first index of the preorder array and the right tree which is the right half of 
    the index after the middle in the inorder array and the right half of the index in the preorder array of that same length
4. Time Complexity: O(n^2) due to finding the index taking O(n) time
5. Space Complexity: O(1) excluding the result
6. Learnings: Or condition for the terminal null values. Return the tree on initialisation

column
3. Pseudo Code:
    1. Initialise a dfs function that takes in a n, the starting row and starting column
    2. Go through the bounded area to check if the number is the same through, if it is, return the node initialised to isLeaf and the same value

    4. Create a node where it is not leaf and initalise its four children to be calls to dfs at the different starting points seperated by n
4. Time Complexity: O(n^2log(n)). The grid will be broken up into log n levels, where at each level, n^2 is need to calculate the isSame
5. Space Complexity: O(1)
6. Learnings: Check for isSame, else recursively initialise the other child nodes 


Count the number of good nodes in the binary tree

3. Pseudo Code:
    1. Initiliase a dfs function with the max value
    2. if the node is null, return 
    3. If the current node is less than or equal to the maximum, ignore

2. Idea: Do a postorder to find a node of the given value. If the child node is of that value, make it null
3. Pseudo Code:
    1. Do a post order traversal as we want to process the children nodes before the parent nodes
    2. Have node.left = dfs to the left and node.right = dfs to the right
    3. If the current node is a leaf, have null left and right trees, and its value is the given value, return null
4. Time Complexity: O(n)
5. Space Compelxity: O(1)
6. Learnings: Need not process from the child node. Just go all the way down and if the child node is to be deleted, return None upwards in the call stack


Delete Node in BST

1. Edge Case: 
2. Idea: After the removal of the specific node, if it is not a leaf node, you would want to replace it with the smallest other node in the subtree. 
3. Pseudo Code:
    1. Do a dfs to find the node with the given value. dfs of a binary tree would include checking whether the root value is less than or more than the current to see which side of subtrees to visit
    2. When found, if the node has no right child, return its left child. If the node has no left child, return the right child, if both are null, return null
    3. Else, go rightward one step then find the leftmost value in the BST. Replace that node with the node in question and then call the function on that node with the leftmost value
4. Time Complexity: O(n)
5. Space Complexity: O(1)
6. Learnings: Returning of children if it has a null child node. Replacing with next smallest element and calling dfs on that element


House Robber 3

1. Edge Case: Same value with different robbing paths
2. Idea: Break down into sub problems, the maximum sub problems will return the optimal solution. At each path, either include the root but not the most recent node or exclude the root but take the most recent nodes
3. Pseudo Code:
    1. Initialise a dfs function that takes in a node. 
    2. Have the terminal condition that if node is null, return [0, 0]
    3. For left and right, obtain the values of leftWith, leftWithout, rightWith and rightWithout
    4. Return the two values, the values with and without the current node. The first value is the node value + leftwithout and right without and the second is the sum of max between lwith and lwithout and rwith and rwithout
    5. Do for both with and without the root and return the value
4. Time Complexity: O(n)
5. Space Complexity: O(1)
6. Learnings: Max value can be obtained either from taking the root plus the withouts of the max value between with and withouts summed*

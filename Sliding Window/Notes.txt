1. Edge Case: non-increasing array
2. Idea: Implement a sliding window that restarts when the right pointer is less than the left pointer
3. Pseduo Code: 
    1.Initialise the left pointer and have a for loop that moves the right pointer
    2. When the value of the right pointer is more than that of the left pointer, record this value to the res
    3. Else, let the left pointer = right pointer
4. Time Complexity: O(n)
5. Space Complexity: O(1)
6. Learnings: No need to iterate through every possiblility if the delta between the left and right pointer is negative


Contains duplicate 2
1. Edge Case: k is less than zero
2. Idea: have a sliding window of size k where all elements in the window are distinct, else return false
3. Pseudo Code: 
    1. Have a for loop to represent the right pointer and a set to save the elements in the window
    2. At each loop, check if the new element is already in the set
    3. r - l >= k, increment l by 1 and remove the element from the set
4. Time Complexity: O(n)
5. Space Complexity: O(n)
6. Learnings: Code is simplier if there is just a check whether r - l >= k as a condition to increment l

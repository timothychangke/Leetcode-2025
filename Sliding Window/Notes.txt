Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

1. Edge Case: non-increasing array
2. Idea: Implement a sliding window that restarts when the right pointer is less than the left pointer
3. Pseduo Code: 
    1.Initialise the left pointer and have a for loop that moves the right pointer
    2. When the value of the right pointer is more than that of the left pointer, record this value to the res
    3. Else, let the left pointer = right pointer
4. Time Complexity: O(n)
5. Space Complexity: O(1)
6. Learnings: No need to iterate through every possiblility if the delta between the left and right pointer is negative

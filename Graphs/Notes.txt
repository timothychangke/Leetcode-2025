Find the Town Judge

1. Edge Case: There is no town judge
2. Idea: For each trust connection, increment the second element. And decrement the trustee as the judge cannot trust others. Then check if there is an element with n - 1 elements
3. Pseudo Code:
    1. Initialise a arry of n 0s
    2. For each tuple in the trust array, decrement the truster and increment the trustee'
    3. Loop through the array and if there is an element that has a count of n - 1, return true, else return false
4. Time Complexity: O(n)
5. Space Complexity: O(n)
6. Learnings: Solve with simple counting and not graphs

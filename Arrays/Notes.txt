Add to Array-Form of Integer

1. Edge Cases: Adding from an empty array, adding zeros, handling carry overs
2. Pseudo code:
    1. Initialise a carry value, a result value, a pointer that traverses the array backwards
    2. While the pointer is greater than zero or sum or carry:
        - Sum the all the elements together and mod them by 10, obtain the carry by doing floor division by 10
        - Add this value to the res by multiplying it with 10 * pow
        - Decrement the pointer, divide the number by 10 and increment the pow
        - If the num is 0, have it return 0 in the sum. if the index is <= 0, have it return zero in the sum (handling of overflow)
    3. Return res
3. Time Complexity: O(n + m)
4. Learnings:
- Use the pow method to append to the front of a number
- Use floor division to obtain the carry


Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

1. Edge Cases: empty array?, one element array?, two element array with non-increasing values?
2. Pseudo Code:
    1. Initialise the left and right pointers and a res variable
    2. While the right pointer does not exceed the length of the array:
        - if the value at the right pointer is more than the value at the left, save it to res if it is greater than res
        - else, let left = right 
        - increment right by one
    3. Return res
3. Time Complexity: O(n)
4. Learnings:
 - Reset sliding window when the delta is no longer positive


Concatenation of Array

1. Edge Cases: empty array
2. Pseudo Code:
    1. Return the array multiplied by two
3. Time Complexity: O(n)


Contains Duplicates

1. Edge Cases: empty array?, all duplicates, no duplicates
2. Pseudo Code:
    1. Turn both arrays into sets and compare the lengths of both sets
    2. Return if the length of the sets are the same
3. Time Complexity: O(n)

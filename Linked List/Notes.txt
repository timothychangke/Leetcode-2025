Add two numbers

1. Edge Case: Addition of two numbers of difference lengths, negative numbers
2. Idea: Initialse a carry and pointers to traverse the numbers. Sum there values and mod by ten to append to the res
3. Pseudo Code:
    1. Initialise a carry and two pointers at the ends of each list. 
    2. If not null, sum their values together, let the sum = sum % 10 and the carry = sum // 10
    3. Increment the points if not null
    4. Repeat until pointers and carry are invalid
4. Time Complexity: O(n)
5. Space Complexity: O(1)
6. Learnings: Create a dummy node for res and return res.next, add the remainder of the two numbers if any, sum and carry can be derived with % and //

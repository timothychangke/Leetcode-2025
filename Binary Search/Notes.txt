1. Edge Case: Element does not exist in array, array contains non-numeric characters?
2. Pseudo Code: 
    1. Initialise a left and right pointer at both ends of the sorted array. 
    2. Find the middle element. 
         - if it is larger than the target, it means that the element in question is in the left half of the array
         - else it is in the right half
    3. If the element is found, return the index of the element
    4. Repeat the loop until the element is found
3. Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
4. Space Complexity: O(1)

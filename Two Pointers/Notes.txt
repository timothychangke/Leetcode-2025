Merge Sorted Arrays

1. Edge Cases: Arrays of different lengths, empty arrays, 
2. Pseudo code:
    1. Initialise two pointers, each one at the start of each array. 
    2. While the pointers are less than the length of their respective arrays, increment them when their value is less than the other, adding this smaller value to the res
    3. If there are still arrays that have yet to be traversed, add these remaining elements into the array
3. Time Complexity: O(m + n)
4. Space Complexity: O(1)
